# MuSe-2024
Multimodal Humor Detection and Social Perception Prediction

The trait-based ensemble is in the [JupyterNotebook](https://github.com/aalto-speech/MuSe-2024/blob/main/trait_based_ensemble.ipynb). The selection of which trait in which groups are based on the correlation of the train set (see [Figure](https://github.com/aalto-speech/MuSe-2024/blob/main/perception_correlation.png))
